# MailMerge
This is a script for helping to create reports it is only an example and should be edited to fit your needs.

I named this mailmerge because it does basically the same function. 

Edit the column names in the Excel file to fit your need, the rows can have more than one input separated by a , in each cell this helps fill out the tables in the Word Document. The main cells that use this feature are Scope_Specifics, Findings, Evidence, Risk, Impact, Risk_Result, and Recommendations. I put some dummy data in the excel but it isn't a serious attempt at making sense.
